### 1. Title: Digital Citizenship
__Problem__: Everyday millions of people get trolled/abused online. Online bulling is depressingly common and everyday several stories about trolling are frequently in news. Is this the kind of digital footprint we would want to leave for the present and upcoming generations? Is there any solution to dealing with trolls and abuse? Can technology help us with this?

__Our proposed solution:__
An API running on intensive machine learning algorithms, which can tackle online trolls and abuse and help us be more digitally responsible. The API would use machine learning models to see the impact of a comment or content whether it would be perceived as abusive or toxic. The API could be used in several places: it could function as an online moderator; it could allow readers to find relevant information by filtering out irrelevant content from the discussion. It could also act as a parental control API, that could allow parents to restrict the view to abusive content on the internet. Also, it can assist commenters in real time, warning them if their comments might be perceived as toxic or abusive.

__Goal:__ With this project our goal is to help leave a clean digital footprint, be more responsible online and help reduce bullying or the side effects of reading abusive content.

__Technology Stack:__ Tensorflow/Keras, NLP, IBM Watson Speech to text, IBM Watson tone analyser (we want to see if the tone has any correlation to abusive comments), ReactJS, Python and other technologies TBD.

### 2. Title: Personalized Restaurant Recommendation System

__Problem__: Often, when we search for a good restaurant online, we spend a lot of time going through reviews and ratings on different websites. This becomes even more difficult when we are in a new city. 

__Proposed solution:__ Our personalized restaurant recommendation system will analyze user’s history data of past restaurant visits, reviews and ratings given by the user to those food joints and user’s profile data. Profile data could be helpful even more in cases when there is no user history available. Added to this analysis will be supporting data for the restaurants ratings in the database given by all other customers as well. The cumulative impact of all such factors would suggest the user real good places to eat out as per his taste and preferences.

__Goal:__ This application is for anyone and everyone using the internet for finding a good place to dine out in very less time so that user experience is enriched and expectations met.

__Technology Stack:__  ReactJS, Python, AWS, Restful API, ML, Other technologies TBD

### 3. Title:Park Smart- On demand Parking spot

__Problem__:  Have you ever roamed around to get a parking space??
Have you ever got a parking ticket? How difficult is to search parking space in a parking lot

__Proposed solution:__ A engine that contionously monitors parking spots and uses computer vision especially Deep learning as well as machine learning methodologies or techniques to analyze the available parking space. It will use techniques to find a spot when the user requests for it. The user just needs to select the location of the parking area or the market place . ParkSmart will indeed search and reserve the parking spot as well as will notify to the user.

__Goal:__ ParkSmart is here to save you. Just use the app, get your parking coordinates that will be reserved for you and you are set.

__Technology Stack:__  Rest API’s using Java/Node Js/Python, Front End Development with React JS/JSTL,Bootstrap 4 and Deployment using Docker on IBM Cloud or AWS, Any other TBD
